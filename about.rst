title: About me
---

I am a software developer by profession who has benefitted immensively from a very limited (and back in grad school, forced) exposure to Haskell. I maintained a love-despair relationship with the language and kept coming back to it every other year or so. I'm hoping this n'th attempt will be succesful. Please be kind and wish me luck as I journey into the beautiful world of Haskell.
